    "# Exercise 6 – Linking Opportunity Index & ACE Proxy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will examine how community opportunity factors relate to a proxy measure of **Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)** using census tracts in New Jersey.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Variables:**\n",
    "*   **SDH Indicators:** Census tract level z-scores for specific Social Determinants of Health (SDH).\n",
    "*   **ACE Proxy:** A county-level variable (child welfare cases per 1,000 children) that is repeated for all tracts within a county.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you will produce:**\n",
    "1.  A **choropleth map** of your assigned SDH variable (`CASE_VAR_Z`) at the tract level. A **choropleth map** is a thematic map where each geographic area is shaded according to a data value. \n",
    "2.  **Correlation (r) and scatterplot** of your SDH variable vs. the ACE proxy (`cw_cases_per_1000_Z`).\n",
    "3.  **Correlations (r) and scatterplots** of two mini-indices (Education and Social/Economic) vs. the ACE proxy.\n",
    "4.  **Correlation (r) and scatterplot** of the overall composite (`COI_mini`) vs. the ACE proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** When you interpret these correlations in your slides, remember that SDH variables are tract-level while the ACE proxy is county-level. These are cross-level correlations and do not show individual-level causation."
