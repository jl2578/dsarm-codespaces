The **empirical SE** (calculated from the spread of 1000 sample means) is **0.233**, which is very close to the **theoretical SE** of **0.225** computed from the formula $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n} = 1.593/\\sqrt{50}$. \n",

As predicted by the Central Limit Theorem, this sampling distribution is approximately normal (bell-shaped) and centered around the true population mean of 2.512. Most sample means fall within a narrow range around this value – specifically, most fall between roughly 2.0 and 3.0.

It quantifies our uncertainty in the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean. By using only Wave 21 data, we ensure that each observation is independent (no subject appears twice), which is a critical assumption for the standard error formula $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$ to be valid. The close agreement between empirical SE (0.233) and theoretical SE (0.225) confirms that our sampling procedure and the formula work as expected. In practice, we often estimate SE by $s/\\sqrt{n}$ (using the sample's standard deviation $s$), since we usually have only one sample rather than the full population."
