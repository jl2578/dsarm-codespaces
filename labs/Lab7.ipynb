        "**Learning Objectives**  \n",
        "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:  \n",
        "1. **Formulate and test hypotheses for one mean** using one-sample *t*-tests (and *z*-tests conceptually) in the context of public policy and health data.  \n",
        "2. **Calculate and interpret confidence intervals** for a sample mean, and understand the relationship between a 95% CI and a two-sided hypothesis test at α = 0.05.  \n",
        "3. **Quantify effect size** using **Cohen's d**, and discuss why statistical significance (p-value) does not always imply practical significance (considering confidence intervals and effect sizes).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Important Note About the Data\n",
        "\n",
        "**This lab uses synthetic data designed to illustrate statistical concepts and common patterns in policy research.** While the data are based on real-world policy research findings and demonstrate authentic challenges (selection bias, confounding, statistical vs. practical significance), exact effect sizes may differ from published studies. \n",
        "\n",
        "For actual policy evaluation, researchers use more sophisticated causal inference designs (difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, instrumental variables, randomized controlled trials) to establish causality beyond simple group comparisons. The patterns you'll observe here—especially regarding selection bias in policy adoption—reflect real methodological challenges in observational research.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Background & Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use a synthetic dataset (~11,600 adolescents at baseline, with follow-up data at age ~21) derived from the ABCD study. This dataset includes state-level policy indicators and individual health/behavior outcomes. Key variables for this lab include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Marijuana Law Classification** (`le_l_lawsmj__mjlaws__state_indicator`): Categorical state policy for marijuana access (1 = Recreational legal, 2 = Medical only, 3 = CBD-only/Low THC, 4 = No legal access).  \n",
        "- **ACA Medicaid Expansion** (`le_l_aca__addr1__acaexpand_indicator`): Whether the participant's state expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (1 = Yes/Expanded, 0 = No).  \n",
        "- **Opioid Prescribing Rate** (`le_l_rxopioid__addr1__opioidrx_rate__yb0`): Annual opioid prescription rate in the state (per 100 population, baseline year; national average ≈ 55). Higher values = more opioid prescriptions per capita.  \n",
        "- **PDMP \"Must Access\" Law** (`le_l_rxmonit__addr1__pdmp__mustaccess_indicator`): Indicator if the state had a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program must-check mandate for providers (1 = Yes, 0 = No). This policy aims to curb excessive prescribing.  \n",
        "\n",
        "*Note:* Some variables use special codes for missing data (e.g., `999` for questionnaire non-response). We will filter out such values in our analyses as needed so they do not distort our results."

        "**Demo:** Does legalizing recreational marijuana affect youth cannabis use? In this demo, we focus on youths from states with **Recreational marijuana laws** and test whether their average cannabis use is different from youths in states with **no legal access**. Our outcome of interest will be the **total marijuana dose (TLFB)** the youth has ever used by early adulthood (age ~21). We’ll conduct a one-sample t-test to see if the mean total dose in recreational-marijuana states differs from a reference value. Here, we’ll use the mean in \"no legal access\" states as the reference (as if it were a known population value).\n",

Let μ = mean total dose used in rec-legal states. Our null hypothesis is H<sub>0</sub>: μ = μ<sub>0</sub>, where μ<sub>0</sub> is the no-law states’ average. The two-sided alternative H<sub>a</sub>: μ ≠ μ<sub>0</sub>. (We suspect it might be higher, but we’ll test two-sided to be conservative.)  \n",
        "2. **Compute sample statistics:** Calculate the sample mean, standard deviation, and standard error for total marijuana dose (TLFB) in the recreational-law group. We’ll use wave 21 (age ~21) data for a cumulative measure of use. We will treat individuals with no use (NaN in the data) as 0 to include them in the average.  \n",
        "3. **One-sample t-test:** Compute the t-statistic: t = (mean - μ<sub>0</sub>) / SE. Determine degrees of freedom (df = n - 1). Calculate the p-value for the two-sided test.  \n",
        "4. **95% Confidence Interval:** Compute the 95% CI for the true mean μ. This is mean ± t·SE, where t is the critical value for df at 95% confidence (~1.96 for large df).  \n",
        "5. **Effect size (Cohen’s d):** Calculate d = (mean - μ<sub>0</sub>) / s, which measures the difference in means in standard deviation units. Interpret this magnitude (small ~0.2, medium ~0.5, large ~0.8).  \n",

        "**Demo:** Do public health policies translate into better community conditions for children and families? Here we examine states' **Medicaid expansion** status under the ACA (Affordable Care Act) and a measure of social determinants: the **Child Opportunity Index (COI)**. The COI is a z-score (nationally normed) that captures neighborhood resources like quality schools, green spaces, economic opportunity, and health resources. States that expanded Medicaid aimed to increase healthcare access and improve overall well-being, which might be reflected in higher COI scores. We will test whether youths in expansion states have, on average, higher COI scores than the national average. Since the COI is a z-score, the national mean is **0**. Let's test if the mean COI in expansion states is **greater than 0** (if the policy had a beneficial effect on community conditions). This will be a **one-sided** test.\n",

H<sub>0</sub>: μ = 0 (no difference from national average), H<sub>a</sub>: μ > 0 (mean is above the national average, indicating better neighborhood opportunity). We choose a one-tailed test since we have a directional hypothesis (we expect higher COI in expansion states).  \n",
        "2. **Sample statistics:** Filter the baseline data (age ~16) for participants in expansion states (where `acaexpand_indicator = 1`). Calculate mean, SD, SE of COI z-score.  \n",
        "3. **One-sample t-test:** Compute t = (mean - 0)/SE. Here a positive t (mean > 0) in the right tail would support H<sub>a</sub>. Compute the one-sided p-value for t (upper tail).  \n",
        "4. **95% CI:** Calculate the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the mean. Even though our test is one-sided, we will compute the 95% CI to see the plausible range for the mean COI z-score.  \n",

This is statistically significantly above the national average of 0. The one-sample t-test yields **t(6848) = 59.502, p ≈ 0** (essentially zero), so we **reject H<sub>0</sub>** and conclude that youths in Medicaid expansion states live in neighborhoods with significantly higher opportunity than the national average.\n",

The effect size **Cohen's d = 0.719** is considered a **medium-to-large effect**, indicating that expansion states are about 0.7 standard deviations above the national average. This is a meaningful difference in z-score terms. Yet, the **raw difference** in COI z-score is only **0.022** — a very small absolute shift on the z-score scale. The 95% confidence interval **[0.021, 0.023]** is extremely narrow (does not include 0, confirming significance), but the range is also very small.\n",

With a **very large sample** (n = 6,849), even a **tiny difference** (0.022 z-score units) becomes highly statistically significant (p ≈ 0). The Cohen's d suggests a moderate-to-large effect because the standard deviation is also small (0.030), magnifying the relative size of the difference. \n",

        "\n",
        "**Demo:** In this demo, we examine a case where a result can be statistically significant but practically small. Consider the impact of a strict Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) policy. **“Must access” PDMP laws** require prescribers to check a database before prescribing opioids, intended to reduce excessive opioid prescriptions. We’ll test if states **without** a must-access PDMP have a higher opioid prescribing rate than the national average (which is about 55 per 100 people). \n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, let’s focus on baseline data and take the group of participants in states without a must-access PDMP. We test H<sub>0</sub>: μ = 55 vs H<sub>a</sub>: μ > 55 (one-sided, expecting higher prescribing in absence of strict monitoring). Our outcome is the state opioid prescription rate (`opioidrx_rate`) which is the same for everyone in a state (but appears in each individual’s data).\n",
        "\n",
        "*Steps:*  \n",
        "1. **Hypotheses:** μ = mean opioid prescribing rate in non-must-access states. H<sub>0</sub>: μ = 55, H<sub>a</sub>: μ > 55 (we anticipate these states might have above-average prescribing due to laxer policy).  \n",
        "2. **Sample statistics:** Filter baseline (wave == 16) for participants in states where `pdmp_mustaccess_indicator = 0` (no mandatory PDMP). Compute mean, SD, SE of the prescribing rate. (Note: Many individuals share the same state values, but we’ll treat the sample at face value.)  \n",
        "3. **One-sample t-test:** Calculate t = (mean - 55)/SE, with a one-sided test (upper tail).  \n",
        "4. **95% CI:** Compute the 95% CI for the mean.  \n",
        "5. **Cohen’s d:** Compute d = (mean - 55)/SD.  \n",
        "6. **Interpretation:** We expect to reject H<sub>0</sub> if the mean is even slightly above 55 due to the large sample. Pay special attention to the effect size and CI — they may show that the difference, while significant, is minor in magnitude.\n",

        "**Important Note on Real-World Evidence:** This activity uses **synthetic data** to illustrate methodological concepts about selection bias and cross-sectional comparisons. In reality, rigorous studies using longitudinal and quasi-experimental designs (difference-in-differences, interrupted time series) have found that **PDMP must-access laws DO reduce opioid prescribing by 5-10%** when implemented (Buchmueller & Carey, 2018; Meara et al., 2016). However, the **selection bias pattern demonstrated here is real**: states with worse opioid crises were more likely to adopt strict PDMP laws, which is why cross-sectional comparisons (like we perform below) cannot establish causality. The pedagogical point—that observational policy research requires careful causal inference designs—reflects authentic challenges in this field.\n",

The one-sample test yields **t(9067) = -17.077**, with a **one-tailed p = 1.0** for the alternative hypothesis H<sub>a</sub>: μ > 55. This result is the **opposite** of what our one-tailed hypothesis predicted! The 95% confidence interval is **[52.46, 52.99]**, which does **not** include 55 and is entirely below it. **Cohen's d = -0.179**, a small negative effect.\n",

        "\n",
        "**The Real Story - Selection Bias:** This is a classic example of **confounding by indication** in policy research. States don't adopt policies randomly:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **States WITH PDMP laws**: Likely adopted them *because* they had **high baseline prescribing rates** and a serious opioid problem. The policy was a **response to crisis**.\n",
        "2. **States WITHOUT PDMP laws**: May have had **lower baseline prescribing** and didn't feel the policy was urgent or necessary. No crisis, no policy.\n",
        "\n",
        "So when we compare them cross-sectionally, we're seeing the **pre-existing differences** that drove policy adoption, not the policy's effect. States with PDMP laws started from a worse position; states without them had less of a problem to begin with.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Wrong-Tailed Test:** We tested H<sub>a</sub>: μ > 55, expecting no-PDMP states to be *above* average. But they're actually *below* average (p = 1.0 for that tail). If we had tested H<sub>a</sub>: μ < 55, we'd get p ≈ 0 and \"reject\" the null—but this would be **misleading** because it doesn't account for selection bias. The \"significant\" result wouldn't tell us whether PDMP laws work; it would just confirm that states self-select into policies based on need.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Lessons:**\n",
        "1. **Cross-sectional comparisons can't establish causality**: We can't compare states with/without policies as if they were randomly assigned. Pre-existing differences confound everything.\n",
        "2. **Direction matters in one-tailed tests**: We picked the wrong tail based on naive reasoning. Always explore data first before committing to a directional hypothesis.\n",
        "3. **Small effect, big significance**: Even though the result is highly significant (huge sample, narrow CI), the effect size is small (d = -0.179 ≈ 2.3 prescriptions per 100 people difference). Statistical significance ≠ practical importance.\n",
        "4. **Policy evaluation is hard**: To know if PDMP laws *work*, we'd need longitudinal data (before/after comparisons within states) or quasi-experimental designs (difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, etc.)—not just snapshots of who has which policies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bottom line:** This example shows why **observational policy research** requires careful design. A \"significant\" cross-sectional difference tells us almost nothing about whether a policy is effective when states self-select into policies based on the very outcomes we're trying to measure."

        "\n",
        "1. **Descriptive Results:**\n",
        "   - What is the mean prescribing rate in PDMP states?\n",
        "   - Is it above or below the national average (55)?\n",
        "   - What is the raw difference from the national average?\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Statistical Significance:**\n",
        "   - Is the difference statistically significant? (Check the p-value)\n",
        "   - Does the 95% CI include 55? What does this tell you?\n",
        "   - What is Cohen's d? Is the effect size small, medium, or large?\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **The Selection Bias Story:**\n",
        "   - Combining Activity 3 Demo (no-PDMP states had LOW prescribing) and Your Turn 3 (PDMP states had ??? prescribing), what pattern emerges?\n",
        "   - Does this support the hypothesis that states adopt policies **in response to crises** rather than randomly?\n",
        "   - What does this tell us about the limitations of cross-sectional policy comparisons?\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Causal Inference Challenge:**\n",
        "   - If PDMP states have higher prescribing rates even WITH the policy in place, does that mean the policy doesn't work?\n",
        "   - Why can't we answer \"Do PDMP laws reduce prescribing?\" with this cross-sectional design?\n",
        "   - What research design would you need to properly evaluate whether PDMP laws are effective? (Hint: think about longitudinal/before-after comparisons, or matching states with similar baseline characteristics)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Practical vs. Statistical Significance:**\n",
        "   - Even if the result is statistically significant, how large is the practical difference in prescribing rates?\n",
        "   - From a public health perspective, is the magnitude meaningful?\n",
        "   - How does sample size affect your ability to detect even small differences?\n",
